## C Programming Tasks (IoT Prep)

These C programs were developed to simulate randomness testing using pseudorandom number generation. Each task helps build the foundations for understanding data behavior in embedded and IoT systems.

| Filename          | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `HelloWorld.c`    | Simple program that prints "Hello, GitHub World!" |
| `mean_test.c`     | Generates 1000 random numbers and calculates the mean (expected ~4.5) |
| `frequency_test.c`| Generates 10,000 random digits (0‚Äì9), checks if distribution is ~10% each |
| `odd-even_test.c` | Generates 10,000 numbers and checks 50/50 split between odd and even |
| `serial_test.c`   | Generates 10,000 digit pairs (00‚Äì99), verifies ~1% frequency for each |

## Network Traffic Analysis

Analysis of two packet capture (PCAP) cases from [malware-traffic-analysis.net](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/), including identification of attack patterns, suspicious IPs, payloads, and infection methods.
